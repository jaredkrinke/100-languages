# 100 Programming Languages in 100 Days
This repository tracks a [misguided quest to write code in 100 different programming languages](https://log.schemescape.com/posts/programming-languages/100-languages.html) (specifically by solving the first 100 [Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net/) problems), maybe even in 100 (almost certainly non-consecutive) days.
